# Weather forecast 

Simple application to display weather forecasting information.

## Setup development environment 

`git clone` - Clone the repository 

`npm install` - To install node dependencies 

`bower install` - To install client dependencies

## Build, development and test

`grunt` to ensure linting, unit test and build the app.

`grunt serve` for local development and preview.

`grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.

###  TODO

 - Allow user to select city
 - Detect user location using geoloction and load weather of that location 
 - Update the directory structure to modularize the application
 - Secure the api key by moving the service call to server side
 - Improve UI/UX
